To try peerfuse:

Compilation:
# if you want to compile peerfuse-net
make pfnet 
#or if you want to compile peerfuse-lan
make pflan 

make install won't work, no need to try it.

Running:
On the root folder, run:
# as root
modprobe fuse
# then check your normal user have access to /dev/fuse
# the quick way:
chmod 666 /dev/fuse
# or tune your configuration of udev

#  edit the default config file and you're ready to start peerfuse :
./build.peerfuse-net/peerfuse-net pfnet.conf -d /path/to/mount/folder

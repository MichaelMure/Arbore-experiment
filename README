This is a fork of the Peerfuse project. The goal is to implement a new
kind of sharing network. Ideal future characteristic are:
* acentred network (run with a DHT)
* Really easy to use
* Multi-platform

Main goal:
* Allow peoples to share arbitrary data with others, without needs to
  use cloud based hosting service, especially if they are located in the
  United State (Patriot Act).
* Allow peoples to easily choose who can access the data.
* Allow peoples to share publicly signed data.

Dependences:
------------

* cmake
* pkg-config
* libssl-dev
* libcurl-dev

Compilation:
------------

To compile Arbore
$ cmake .
$ make

make install won't work, no need to try it.

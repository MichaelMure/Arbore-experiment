| 00026 |  Open  |  PFnet   |            | Implement peer spy against security issues (see notes)
| 00025 |  Open  |  PFnet   |            | Implement new cache system in DHT
| 00024 |  Open  |  PFnet   |            | Remove FileDist and store files in new DHT
| 00023 |  Open  |   SSL    |            | At first start, generate a private/public key pair, and use it instead of certificates
| 00022 |  Open  |   DHT    |   romain   | Implement the Chimera DHT
| 00021 |  Open  |  Global  |            | Use the default "libconfig" library instead of our own parser (common/libconfig.h)
| 00020 |  Open  |  Global  | hydromiel  | Support IPv6
| 00019 | Closed |  PFnet   |   romain   | PeersListBase might have a protected vector base class, not public. And PeerFromID() might be
|       |        |          |            |    protected method.
| 00018 |  Open  |  PFnet   |            | NET_PEER_CONNECTION: check certificates to disallow a peer to introduce a fake
|       |        |          |            |    peer with an unvalid certificate.
| 00017 | Closed |  PFnet   |   romain   | Related to the bug #00008, add a timer to send a MKFILE only a second after. So, when we want
|       |        |          |            |    to send 1000 MKFILE (for example because of a `cp'), only one per second will be sent.
| 00016 |  Open  |  Global  |            | Support file moving/renaming.
| 00015 |  Open  |  PFnet   |            | To prevent unlimited loop, when I receive a NET_MKFILE for a file older than mine, if I send a
|       |        |          |            |   NET_MKFILE to correct him, store it somewhere to do that one time. If I receive the
|       |        |          |            |   same message from the same peer, do not correct him.
| 00014 |  Open  |  PFnet   |            | Set an expiration time for LS_DIR
| 00013 |Canceled|  Global  |            | Do not show files which are not available on network
| 00012 |  Open  |  Global  |            | Change cmake files to port peerfuse to Mac OS X (use pkg-config for fuse and openssl)
| 00011 | Closed |  PFnet   |   romain   | Update FileDistribution when a peer is disconnected from network
| 00010 |  Open  |  Global  |            | Merge options workdir/ and cache/, pf should creates the config arborescence by itself
| 00009 |  Open  |  Global  |            | Assign a number to a newly created network to avoid a cache if someone tries to connect
|       |        |          |            |   with a cache from a different network
| 00008 |  Open  |  Global  |            | Add a chroot option
| 00007 | Closed |  PFnet   |   romain   | NET_LS_DIR
| 00006 |  Open  |  PFnet   |            | Store owner and group of file somewhere else than cache's
|       |        |          |            |   files properties.
| 00005 | Closed |  PFnet   |   romain   | When a low link is established from an ID which is already
|       |        |          |            |   present in the peers_list, do not remove the first Peer,
|       |        |          |            |   but do it only when we receive the HELLO message.
| 00004 |  Open  |  Global  |            | Catch SIGHUP to reload the configuration file
| 00003 |  Open  |  Global  |            | Catch SIGTERM to call Application::Exit()
| 00002 |  Open  |  Global  |            | Simplify logging system (we only need DEBUG/WARNING/ERRORS)
| 00001 |?Closed?| FileSys. |            | Support file deletion (mark file as deleted in tree_cfg, truncate
|       |        |          |            |   them in the cache)
